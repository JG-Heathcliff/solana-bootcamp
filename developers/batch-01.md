### Andre Aquino
> Hi, I'm Andre. I have experience in building desktop GUI applications with Java. I can also accomplish data mining tasks such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model training and testing towards classification and clustering goals using Python. Currently, I am traversing the field of blockchain, specifically Solana. I entered the bootcamp in hopes of acquiring skills and expanding my view in the industry. It has been a rewarding decision.
