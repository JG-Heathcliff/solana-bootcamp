# Solana Developers Bootcamp - Batch 1 Participants
### Kenneth Panes
> Oracle database developer with 13 years of experience working with the largest retailers around the world. Got hooked into learning cryptocurrency and explored DeFi, NFT's and its potential use cases. 

> As blockchain is another form of database might as well learn it and looking to build something out of my tech stack. 

> Found that the BLOKC is hosting the 1st Solana Developers Bootcamp which gave a good jump start on being a developer on the web 3 space.
